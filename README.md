## Project context
> An airline wants to create an application to manage the bookings of the flights offered. The application must have a back office to manage the flights and also a front office so that the users follow the status of their reservations and can also print the flight ticket.
## Constraint and instructions:
> - Carry out the UML design of the application (Use Case and Classes diagram) according to the following criteria:
Three entities to plan: users, flights, reservations
> - Users must register to be able to book flights. Users can modify and cancel reservations that already have.

> - - (Optional) The form can manage multi-destination reservations
> - (Optional) The user can print the flight ticket via the app
> - Carried out the back-office of the application where the admin can manage the flights offered (flight CRUD) and see the reservations.
## Technological constraints:
> - The application must be programmed in PHP with the principles of object oriented programming.
> - The application must respect the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)
> - Using Bootstrap
